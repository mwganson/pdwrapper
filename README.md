# PDWrapper
Part Design Wrapper object.  Encapsulates objects created outside Part Design for use inside Part Design bodies in FreeCAD.  For example, if you wish to use a Part workbench primitive, such as a Tube object in a Part Design model you can add it to the active body by selecting it and running the macro.  The macro creates a PDWrapper feature python object to encapsulate the Tube and allow it to work in the Part Design body.  In a new body the tree would look like this:

<pre>
Body
    Origin
    PDWrapper
        Tube
</pre>

## Installation
PDWrapper is not yet available in the addon manager.  To install you need to copy the pdwrapper.FCMacro file to your macro folder.  On first run it will offer to create another file: pdwrapper.py in the same folder.  This new file is needed in order to import the class definitions from it upon restarting FreeCAD and loading a document containing a saved PDWrapper object.  If it is not created the macro will still work, but upon restarting the PDWrapper objects stored in a document will be broken.

## Usage
Select the object to encapsulate and run the macro.  The macro will create the PDWrapper object and put it and the object being encapsulated into a Body, of one exists.  If there is no Body in the active document the macro will exit with an error message without creating the PDWrapper object.  If there is only one Body object, then the PDWrapper and the Linked Object will go into that Body.  If there are more than 1 Bodies in the document, then the active body will be used, if one is active.  If no Body is active, then a dialog will pop up asking the user to select the Body.<br/>
<br/>
Other dialogs will follow.  You will be asked the desired PDWrapper type to create and where to put the PDWrapper in the Body.<br/>
## Understanding Part Design
It's important to understand Part Design and how it works to make proper use of the PDWrapper objects. The Body will have a Tip property (but sometimes this can be NULL).  The feature that is the Tip will be the Body's shape.  For example, if you use the Body in a boolean operation in Part workbench, such as to cut it from another object, the Tip shape is what is used in the boolean operation.  Each feature in the Body (example: Pad, Pocket, Additive Cylinder, Fillet) is a solid object that is fused with (or in the case of Subtractive types, cut from) the previous solid.  They're all connected in a chain culminating in the final solid feature, which is the Tip (usually).  Non-solid objects may also reside in the Body, such as Sketches, Datum Planes, ShapeBinders, but they do not form part of this chain, at least not directly.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose you have the following model:<br/>
<br/>
<pre>
Body
    Origin
    Pad
        Sketch
    Pocket
        Sketch001
    Fillet
    Box (Additive Box)
</pre>
The Pad's shape is an extrusion of Sketch.  The Pocket's shape is an extrusion of Sketch001 that has been cut from Pad's shape.  Fillet's shape is a dressup or modification of Pocket's shape.  Box's shape is a cube that has been fused with Fillet's shape.
## PDWrapper Types
There are several options for the type of PDWrapper object.  The object type must be selected during creation time because it cannot be changed dynamically later.  If later you wish to change PDWrapper types you will need to delete the object and create a new one, but in some instances the necessary changes can be made dynamically.
### Additive
This PDWrapper type adds to (fuses with) the previous solid feature in the Body.  If it is used in a Part Design pattern feature, such as in a polar pattern feature, the copies produced will add to the existing geometry.
